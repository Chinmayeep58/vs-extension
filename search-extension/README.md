# search-extension README

This is an extension that allows user to open the webpages inside the vscode environment saving the effort of switching the tabs.

## Features


- 🔎 Search the web using Bing
- 📄 View search results in a VS Code WebView
- 🌐 Click on any result to open the full page inside VS Code
- 🧭 Stay focused in your editor — no need to open an external browser

## Requirements

To use this extension, make sure:
- Node.js is installed
- The local server is running:

```bash
node server.js
```

## Known Issues

This extension might not open all the websites due to some limitations, and I am working on it.
